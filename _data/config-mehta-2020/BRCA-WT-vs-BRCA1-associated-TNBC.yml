  Name: BRCA-WT vs BRCA1-associated TNBC
  Header: |
    We profiled both T-cell and macrophage populationsn in tissue resection specimens from untreated patients with either _BRCA_-WT or _BRCA1_-associated TNBC.

    t-CyCIF was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors. Entire tissue sections were analyzed yielding ~ 2 x 10<sup>5</sup> segmented and profiled cells per specimen.
